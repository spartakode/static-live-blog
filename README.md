#Static Live Blog

The Static Live Blog is a meteor based live blog engine that converts the
finalised post into a static html post. The idea is to post it directly to the 
static blog. But it would be nice to post the text over to a blog of one's
choice. The main thing is that the live blogging part is disconnected from the
standard blogging experience.
